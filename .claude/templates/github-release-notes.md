# GitHub Release Notes Template

Use this when running `gh release edit vX.Y.Z --notes "..."`.

Fill every `{placeholder}`. Write only user-facing changes.
Omit: CI fixes, doc cleanups, internal refactors, test changes.

**Format rules:**
- List capabilities added/fixed — one bullet per cap ID
- Do not list individual PRs, authors, or "What's Changed" auto-generated content
- Replace any GitHub-generated release notes entirely with this template
